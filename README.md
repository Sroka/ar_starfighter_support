## Troubleshooting
### The content doesn't look very immersive
It is important to place the portal so that no real-world content intersects with it or occludes it. Big flat surfaces are the best for it. Look at the picture below for best possible conditions

### The content is not stable and moves around
AR cannot work if it doesn't have any feature points to keep track of where the camera is facing. Blank whit wall won't work. Balnk white wall with a picture hanging in the middle will work greate
